Feedback on the tests
We think the tests were good for understanding what we needed to build, but they were also a bit too sensitive. Small things like the text or the order made them fail, which was sometimes difficult. Probably that was the point, to make us be extra careful.

New tests we would add
We would add tests to check that the form blocks empty fields, that an error shows for an invalid email, and that the newest feedback appears first. We would also test what happens if localStorage is empty or broken, and that images include alt text.

What the original tests missed

Form validation (empty fields, wrong email).

How the page looks with no feedback.

The order of feedback (newest first).

That the page doesnâ€™t crash with corrupted localStorage.
